Weather Or Not is an application for keeping track of the weather. It is written in Python and uses GTK 3 for the GUI.

Weather Or Not requires the Python interpreter to run. Development is done using 2.7.x, but it should work with 3.x as well. GTK+ 3 is also required.

To run Weather Or Not, open a terminal in the directory containing the files and type "python weather_or_not.py".

Currently Weather Or Not only works on Linux.
