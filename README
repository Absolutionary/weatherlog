WeatherLog is an application for keeping track of the weather and getting information about past trends. It is written in Python and uses GTK+ 3 for the GUI.

----

WeatherLog requires the Python interpreter to run. Development is done using 2.7.x, but it should work with 3.x as well. GTK+ 3 is also required.

To run WeatherLog, open a terminal in the directory containing the files and type "python weatherlog.py". Currently WeatherLog only works on Linux.

WeatherLog uses pywapi (http://code.google.com/p/python-weather-api/) to get data from weather APIs. See the README and LICENSE files in resources/dialogs/pywapi for more information.

The program icon is from an icon set by Indestudio (http://indestudio.org), available at http://www.iconfinder.com/icondetails/89157/128/weather_icon.
