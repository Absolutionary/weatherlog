Weather Or Not is an application for keeping track of the weather. It is written in Python and uses GTK 3 for the GUI.

Weather Or Not requires the Python interpreter to run. Development is done using Python 2.7.x, but no testing has been done on other versions, so I can't guarantee it will work. GTK+ 3 is required as well.

Currently Weather Or Not only works on Linux.
