# Using WeatherLog

WeatherLog requires the Python interpreter to run. Development is done using 2.7.x, but it should work with 3.x as well. GTK+ 3 is also required.

To run WeatherLog, open a terminal in the directory containing the files and type "python weatherlog.py". Currently WeatherLog only works on Linux and Windows.
