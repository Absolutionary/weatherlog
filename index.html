			<h1>About WeatherLog</h1>
			<p>WeatherLog is an application for keeping track of the weather and getting information about past trends.</p>
            
            <p>WeatherLog can organize weather data and present it in a clear, easy to understand manner. It can also show detailed
            information about patterns and overall info, as well as display graphs to visualize the data.</p>

			<h1>Using WeatherLog</h1>
			<p>WeatherLog requires the <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> interpreter to run. Development is done using 2.7.x,
			but it should work with 3.x as well. <a href="http://www.gtk.org/">GTK+ 3</a> and its Python bindings are also required.
			The graph features also require <a href="http://matplotlib.org/">Matplotlib</a>.</p>

            <p>To run WeatherLog, open a terminal in the directory containing the files and type python weatherlog.py. On some systems
            double-clicking on the <em>weatherlog.py</em> file will also work.</p>

            <p>WeatherLog currently only runs on Linux and Windows. Note that while the application should work on Windows, it is not
            extensively tested on that platform.</p>
